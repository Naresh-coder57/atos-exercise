First, create a checkout system for a shop that only sells apples and oranges. 

Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p. 

The system should take a list of items scanned at the till and output the total cost. 

For example, [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] should return Â£2.05. 

Assume that the input to the solution will be a list of strings.

Next, the shop introduces two new offers: buy one, get one free on apples, and 3 for the price of 2 on oranges. 

Update the checkout functions to accommodate these offers.

To use this application, the technologies used are 

Scala, 

JDK 15,

TDD approach, 

IntelliJ IDEA latest, 

and SBT. 

Compile the application by running "sbt clean" and "sbt run". Run the test cases using "sbt test" in the terminal.
